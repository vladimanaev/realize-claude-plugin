# Accounts

Every other Realize MCP tool requires an `account_id`. This skill resolves one.

## When to use

- The user mentions a new account name, numeric ID, or advertiser.
- No `account_id` is cached for the current session.
- The user's question is ambiguous about which account they mean.
- The user wants to switch accounts.

## Workflow

1. **Call `search_accounts`** with the user's input. The `query` string is routed server-side based on shape: a pure-digits string is treated as a numeric `id` lookup, free text is treated as `search_text`, and `"*"` lists all accounts the authenticated user has access to. Empty or whitespace-only queries raise `ToolInputError`.
   ```
   mcp__realize-mcp__search_accounts(query="<user input>", page_size=10, page=1)
   ```
2. **Inspect the response.** The returned `account_id` is an **opaque string** supplied by the server (examples from upstream docs: `advertiser_12345_prod`, `mktg_corp_001`), not the numeric ID the user might have typed. Do not fabricate, re-case, or otherwise transform it — pass it through verbatim.
3. **Disambiguate if multiple results.** Use `AskUserQuestion` to let the user pick. Show account name + `account_id` string in each option.
4. **Paginate if needed.** If the user's match isn't in the first page, call again with `page=2`, keeping `page_size` constant. Hard cap: `page_size=10`.
5. **Persist the choice** (optional). If the user wants this as their default, write it to `.claude/realize.local.md` (gitignored):
   ```yaml
   ---
   default_account_id: advertiser_12345_prod
   default_account_name: Example Advertiser
   ---
   ```

## Example

**User:** "Pull my Q1 numbers for Example Advertiser."

**You:**
1. `search_accounts(query="Example Advertiser")` → one result, `account_id=advertiser_12345_prod`.
2. Cache it, hand off to `reports` skill for the actual data pull.

**User:** "Show me the acme account."

**You:**
1. `search_accounts(query="acme")` → three matches.
2. `AskUserQuestion`: "Which Acme account?" with each `account_id` as an option.
3. Proceed with the user's pick.

## Gotchas

- **Numeric IDs from the user are not `account_id`s.** Users often say "account 12345" meaning the numeric ID; the MCP expects the opaque string returned by `search_accounts`. The server explicitly rejects numeric-only IDs passed as `account_id` to downstream tools, so always route through `search_accounts` first.
- **Hard page_size cap of 10.** Unlike report tools (cap 100), account search is silently clamped to 10 per page — passing `page_size=50` still returns 10 rows.
- **Use `query="*"`** to list all accounts when the user asks for an inventory, rather than guessing a search term.
- **Don't cache stale account_ids across sessions** without re-validating if the user hasn't confirmed.
